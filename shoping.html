        <p class="qua2">High quality clothing is often made of wool, cotton, cashmere, and silk. Remember that a high content of natural fiber does not necessarily mean a piece of clothing is high quality. You'll also have to look at the construction of the clothing, feel it to make sure it is soft, and make sure that thread work is secure.</p>
